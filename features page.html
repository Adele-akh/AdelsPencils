            <p class="main"><span class="select">Graphite is produced in various grades or degrees according to the softness or hardness of the material. Different grades produce different types of marks. The grade of the pencil is usually designated on the side or the end of the pencil. For drawing pencils, this designation is an alphanumeric value.</p></span>

        <h2>Where does the pencil come from?</h2>

        <div>
            <p class="main"><span class="select">5000 years ago, ancient Egyptians used reed, bamboo or papyrus cane which was filled out with liquid lead as writing utensils. Starting from the 12th century, people wrote with lead alloy pens with a silver soldered tip. Those pencils were used, centuries later, by many artists as silver-pencils for sketching. It is said that lead sticks were used occasionally for writing in the 16th century. Even in the 17th century wood embedded lead stick made from Borrowdale-graphite were used in many countries. In 1662 a »pencil-maker« named Friedrich Staedler, appeared in a Nuremberg Council’s Minutes.</p></span>

        <h2>What is a coloured pencil?</h2>

        <div>
            <p class="main"><span class="select">The › coloured pencil is a pen that has a coloured lead made out of colour pigments, fat, wax, binder and mineral fillers such as talcum or kaolin. It is a writing and drawing utensil, mostly lacquered in the same colour as the lead. Coloured pencils are used as colouring pencils for children, artists’ material but also text markers or drawing pencils. Unlike pencils, coloured pencil lines are hard or almost impossible to erase. Additional special-coloured pencils are watercolour pencils – lines made with those pencils can be overpainted with water afterwards.</p></span>
